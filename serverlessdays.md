# Things I got wrong in Serverless development

## Mistakes

- Rolling my own dev environment
  - from console
  - from cli
  - Solution : use framework
- The shoe-horned lift and shift
  - Solution : Migrate more than lift and shift
- Code over configuration
  - how much logic are you sequeezing into lambda code?
  - how little logic are you invoking lambda function?
  - Solution: less code, more configuration
- Bring the cloud to the developer for testing
  - Solution: SAM accelerator, aws sam sync, aggregated feedback to developers
